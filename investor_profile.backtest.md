# ==========================================================================
# BACKTEST / DEV CONFIG — free to evolve. Read by backtest_gdelt.py, the sweeps and the dashboards.
# Promoting a settled candidate to the live forward test = copying the STRATEGY knobs into
# investor_profile.forward.md as a dated re-freeze (see that file's header).
#
# Order: AI models -> curator -> optimizer -> source allow/block lists.
# Any knob added here must also exist in optimizer._FINANCIAL_MODEL_DEFAULTS or it is SILENTLY
# IGNORED; load_financial_model warns about unknown keys.
#
# HOW THE SIX OPTIMIZER KNOBS BELOW WERE CHOSEN (2026-08-15) -- AND HOW NOT TO CHOOSE THEM.
# DO NOT re-fit these to the top of a single sweep. Three times now that has produced a number that
# did not survive the next curation, because a fresh curation moves the book more than any knob does:
#   - nominal [4, 0.60, 45, 0, 4.0, 0.30] topped v14's sweep at $324,524, then paid $122,408 when
#     v15 re-curated the same window.
#   - v15's own top cell [8, 0.40, 30, 2, 4.0, 0.30] pays $441,877 on v15 and $61,471 on v14 --
#     BELOW SPY's $86,213. A sweep winner is a curation-specific spike until proven otherwise.
#   - and the cell chosen on 2026-08-14 by worst-case plateau across v14+v15,
#     [6, 0.40, 45, 4, 4.0, 0.20], fell to $165,772 on the v4 grouped curation -- 78th percentile,
#     Sharpe 0.85, and it left the book holding NOTHING on 53% of days (32% of trades cancelled).
#     Robustness across two curations of the SAME design did not survive a change of design.
#
# CURRENT CELL [8, 0.25, 14, 0, 4.0, 0.20], set 2026-08-15 off the v4 sweep (data/sweep_v4.json).
# Selected as the highest SHARPE among the 414 of 6,300 cells clearing the shortlist gates
# (max DD < 35%, L2 < 800/yr, Sharpe > 1.2, cancelled < 25%): Sharpe 1.93, $245,283, drawdown 21%,
# cancellation 20.0%. It is NOT the grid's biggest number -- that is $1.52M at a 59% drawdown and
# Sharpe 1.20, which fails three of the four gates and is a lone spike besides (its grid neighbours
# average $310K, a fifth of its own value). Two cells we preferred earlier in the same session,
# [6, 0.40, 21, 0, 4.0, 0.30] ($401K) and [12, 0.40, 30, 0, 4.0, 0.30] ($719K), both fail on L2
# alone (960 and 1003 against the 800 ceiling).
# The chosen cell sits in a tight cluster -- every one of the top ~10 by Sharpe is
# [8, 0.25, 14, 0, *, *] -- so it is a plateau, not a peak.
# CAVEATS, recorded deliberately: (1) this is ONE curation, and the failure mode above is precisely
# that a cell fitted to one curation does not transfer; a second v4-design curation is the cheap way
# to test it ($4.50, ~50 min, no re-ingest). (2) the v4 curation ran --arm fuller, which mixes
# look-ahead-BIASED live ledes; backtest_gdelt.py marks `clean` as the only quotable arm. Per
# CLAUDE.md #4/#6 every figure here is an UPPER BOUND; the forward test is the verdict.
